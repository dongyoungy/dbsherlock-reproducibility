For details on the hardware setup used to collect these datasets, please refer
to the section '8.1 Experiment Setup' of the DBSherlock paper.

There are three datasets that have been used to conduct experiments with
DBSherlock:

  * dbsherlock_dataset_tpcc_16w.mat: an original dataset that is obtained by
  running TPC-C benchmark with scale factor of 16 (i.e. 16 warehouses) as a
  normal workload. We mostly used this dataset to generate experiment results in
  the paper.

  * dbsherlock_dataset_tpcc_500w.mat: an additional dataset that is generated by
  running TPC-C benchmark with scale factor of 500 (i.e. 500 warehouses) as a
  normal workload. This dataset was generated in order to demonstrate DBSherlock's
  scalability on larger workloads, since it was one of the issues that had been
  raised by reviewers. We used this dataset to update experiment results wherever
  applicable.

  * dbsherlock_dataset_tpce_3000.mat: an additional dataset that is generated by
  running TPC-E benchmark with scale factor of 3000.

Please note that only 'dbsherlock_dataset_tpcc_16w.mat' contains datasets for
compound situations. 'dbsherlock_dataset_tpcc_16w.mat' contains seven fields:

  1. causes: a cell structure that contains the name of each performance anomaly
  (i.e., test case).

  2. compound_causes: similar to 'causes', a cell structure that contains the
  name of each compound performance anomaly.

  3. test_datasets: 10-by-11 cell structure, where each row represents different
  test cases and each column represents different duration or start times of the
  anomaly, ranging from 30 seconds to 80 seconds with increment of 5.
  For example, test_datasets{2,4} is a dataset with the anomaly 'Poor Physical Design'
  with the anomaly duration of 45 seconds.

  4. compound_datasets: 6-by-11 cell structure. It is similar to 'test_datasets'.
  Only difference is that each row represents different compound test cases.

  5. normal_regions: this contains the normal region of each dataset in
  'test_datasets' with corresponding indices.

  6. abnormal_regions: this contains the abnormal region of each dataset in
  'test_datasets' with corresponding indices.

  7. normal_regions_compound: this contains the normal region of each dataset in
  'compound_datasets' with corresponding indices.

  8. abnormal_regions_compound: this contains the abnormal region of each dataset
  in 'compound_datasets' with corresponding indices.

'dbsherlock_dataset_tpcc_500w.mat' and 'dbsherlock_dataset_tpce_3000.mat' have
identical fields except they are missing fields related to the compound test
cases.
